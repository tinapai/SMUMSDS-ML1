    "Yes, if the data is sparse, it does change our answer. If the data is sparse, we should use multinomial naive bayes because it would be faster. We can also use Bernoulli if the features are binary. It could be useful to binarize the features to reduce the complexity of the problem. Also it would not be appropriate to use Gaussian for sparse data because there would be so many 0s that a Gaussian distribution would not be a sensible approximation.\n",
