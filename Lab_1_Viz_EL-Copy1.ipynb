    "The dataset that we will examine is the 2017 US Census data. This data was collected to understand the population of the US by measuring for each tract location the demographic make up, the types of jobs, the type of transportation, and the levels of poverty. We are interested in identifying the tracts that have below median level of poverty. Accuracy, precision, and recall will be used to measure the effectiveness of a prediction algorithm."
