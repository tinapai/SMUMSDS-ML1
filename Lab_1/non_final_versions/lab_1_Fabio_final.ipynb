    "The percentage of total CHD events occurring in the population with established CHD was approximately 43% in both men and women, for CHD death 55% and 51%, and for nonfatal MI 35% and 36%, respectively. In those with established CHD 30% had more than 1 recurrent event. Therefore, we choose the cardiac dataset to predict the factors that are related to cardiac events, like hypertention, smoking, cholesterol among others factors. We will analize the outcome of cardiac disease(Miocardial infartion) as yes or not events."

    "Normal blood pressure is below 120/80 mm Hg.If you’re an adult and your systolic pressure is 120 to 129, and your diastolic pressure is less than 80, you have elevated blood pressure. High blood pressure is a systolic pressure of 130 or higher,or a diastolic pressure of 80 or higher, that stays high over time. High blood pressure usually has no signs or symptoms. That’s why it is so dangerous. But it can be managed. Nearly half of the American population over age 20, has HBP, and many don’t even know it. Not treating high blood pressure is dangerous. High blood pressure increases the risk of heart attack and stroke. Stage 1(systolic BP 130 to 140 and dystolic blood presure more than 80) is more dangerous than just high blood pressure. Stage 2(systolic blood presure more than 140 to 180 and dystolic blood pressure more than 90), more dangerous than stage 1. Stage 3(systolic blood pressure more than 180 and dystolic blood pressure more than 120). Stage 3 is more dangerous than stage 1 and 2. In the graph above you can see how the higher the blood pressure in each of the levels(Normal, high blood pressure, stage1, stage 2, stage 3) the most likely to have a heart event."
